# LinkedIn Classic Share

Browser extension that allows one to share using the classic LinkedIn
interface.

Since LinkedIn's recent site redesign, it became difficult to share to
groups, Twitter and contacts at the same time. With this browser
extension, you can share any web page using the same mechanism as the
in-page share buttons, even when the page itself doesn't have the
button.

The extension is available both for Chrome
(https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/classic-share-for-linkedi/djnkioafcbjmfinanpoinhkggkngngee)
and Firefox
(https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/classic-share-for-linkedin/).
